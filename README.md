# Game_crpt
This is a game called ''Crypto''. 

This game consists of two players who secretly choose a number from 1 to 100. The players then take turns trying to guess their opponent's number. Each time you make an attempt, your opponent gives you one of the following responses:
              "You better try again, my number is higher than you guessed"
              "You better try again, my number is lower than you guessed"
               "Right! You guessed my number in X tries"
The object of the game is to guess your opponent's number in as few attempts as possible.
